Geordi
======

Geordi is a collection of command line tools we use in our daily work with
Ruby, Rails and Linux at [makandra](http://makandra.com/).

Installing the *geordi* gem will link several tools into your `/usr/bin` (see
below):

    gem install geordi

Below you can find a list of all included tools.


geordi
------

The base command line utility offering the following commands:

```
$> geordi help
Commands:
  geordi devserver       # Start a development server
  geordi help [COMMAND]  # Describe available commands or one specific command
  geordi migrate         # Migrate all databases
  geordi setup           # Setup a project for the first time
  geordi test            # Run tests
  geordi update          # Bring a project up to date

$> geordi test help
test commands:
  geordi test all             # Run all employed tests
  geordi test cucumber        # Run Cucumber features
  geordi test help [COMMAND]  # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
  geordi test rspec           # Run (R)Spec

```

See command help for details (e.g. `geordi test help cucumber`).

You may abbreviate commands by typing only the first letter(s), e.g. `geordi
dev` will boot a development server, `geordi s -t` will setup a project and run
tests afterwards.
